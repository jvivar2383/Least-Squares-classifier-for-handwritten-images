# Least-Squares-classifier-for-handwritten-images
I used a least squares classier to determine whether an image with a hand written number is a determined number k (for k in [0,9]). The functions is
written from scratch in an aim to understand what is going behind the scenes. The least square classifier attemps to find a beta value that reduces the 
differences os squares from the actual values and those predicted.
